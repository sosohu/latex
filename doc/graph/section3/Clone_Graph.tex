    \item{\textbf{问题}}:\\
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.\\
\\
OJ's undirected graph serialization:\\
Nodes are labeled uniquely.\\
\\
We use $ \sharp $ as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.\\
\textit{(leetcode 133)}
    \item{\textbf{举例}}:\\
As an example, consider the serialized graph ${0,1,2\sharp1,2\sharp2,2}$.\\
\\
The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by $\sharp$.\\
\\
First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.\\
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.\\
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.\\
Visually, the graph looks like the following:\\

    \item{\textbf{BFS+Hash}} : \fbox{时间复杂度O(E), 空间复杂度O(V)}
    \\采用BFS一个个的搜集图的顶点，然后新建顶点和原有顶点通过hash建立一一映射关系方便后来构造neighbors
